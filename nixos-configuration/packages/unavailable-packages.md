# Unavailable packages in Nixpkgs

 - `cargo-deps`: This package provided a dependency graph for Rust projects.
                 This package was removed (from Nixpkgs and all of my Nix
                 projects+configurations) because a third-party takeover was
                 attempted and source upstream is considered tainted.
